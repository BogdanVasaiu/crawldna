// The reveal engine: exhaustively exercise every control that could hide content
// (tabs, accordions, "load more", menus, JS widgets, paginators) and capture each
// revealed state until nothing NEW appears. Universal — it does not care how the
// site is built. AI (aiSelectRevealers) decides WHICH controls hide content; this
// loop decides HOW to traverse them, driven by a small map of explored state.
//
// Traversal model (map-driven, deterministic — no per-click LLM, no per-site code):
// every click is classified by its EFFECT, by comparing the controls (siblings)
// and the state fingerprint before vs after:
//   - IN-PLACE   the siblings stay (a tab swaps text, an accordion opens, a calendar
//                day shows its slots below the grid) → the control is a leaf, clicked
//                once, and we keep going in the same view.
//   - ADVANCING  the siblings are largely replaced by a NEW set with new content (a
//                "next month"/"next page" paginator, a wizard step) → we DON'T retire
//                it; we record which states it was applied from and re-apply it from
//                each new state, walking the whole sequence (June → July → August …)
//                until it stops yielding new states (saturation) or the budget runs
//                out. This is the load-more idea generalised to any view-advancing
//                control — the fix for stateful sequences a one-shot click missed.
//   - NAVIGATED  the click left the page (real URL) or replaced the view with a
//                dead/seen one → recorded as a link, or restoreBase() to recover the
//                siblings.
// A set of visited state fingerprints prevents cycles; the action budget and a
// per-control re-use cap guarantee termination.
