// The render-wait signal (#15): "response-quiet + stable text", bounded.
// Shared by the initial page render (engine/crawl-page.mjs), the reveal loop's
// post-click wait and base restore (engine/actions.mjs, engine/reveal.mjs), and
// the browser-escalation fetch (lib/fetcher.mjs). Pure JS over the Playwright
// page interface — no Playwright import, so it unit-tests with a fake page.

/**
 * Wait for a page's async activity to FULLY land before the caller captures,
 * WITHOUT over-waiting when nothing is happening.
 *
 * The hard case that shaped it (post-click): a widget whose FIRST interaction
 * triggers a one-time cascade of lazy-loaded scripts (a booking calendar pulls
 * in pikaday / jquery-ui / sweetalert / recaptcha the first time a day is
 * picked) that delays the real content — the day's slot grid — by ~1s, during
 * which the visible TEXT sits on a flat plateau. A DOM-stability poll is fooled
 * by that plateau and snapshots the page without the slots; `networkidle` with
 * a fixed timeout either under- or over-waits and, when it over-waits,
 * desynchronises the click→reveal→restore rhythm so per-day panels are lost.
 *
 * The reliable signal is the RESPONSE STREAM: real content arrives on a network
 * response, so wait until a response has come back AND the network has then
 * been quiet for a short grace window, with the DOM text no longer changing.
 * An action that fetches waits exactly as long as its cascade runs; one that
 * fetches NOTHING sees no response and falls through after the same short
 * grace — so no-ops stay cheap. Bounded by maxMs so recaptcha/ads heartbeats
 * can't stall the crawl. Generic — no per-site assumptions.
 *
 * Crucially for the initial render (#15), quietness counts response EVENTS —
 * not open connections like `networkidle` does — so a site holding a
 * websocket / SSE / long-poll connection open (where the idle signal NEVER
 * fires and a networkidle wait burned its full timeout on every page) exits
 * after one grace window like any quiet page.
 *
 * @param {import('playwright').Page} page  anything with on/off('response'),
 *   waitForTimeout(ms) and evaluate(fn) — duck-typed for testability
